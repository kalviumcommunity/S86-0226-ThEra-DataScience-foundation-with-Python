# Top-level data directory. Subfolders separate stages.
# Use `raw/` for original, unmodified inputs and
# `processed/` for cleaned or transformed datasets.
# Do NOT put actual files here; keep it empty except for
# these placeholder files so Git tracks the directories.
# Raw data must be treated as read-only evidence.

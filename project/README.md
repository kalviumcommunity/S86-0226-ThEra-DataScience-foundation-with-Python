# Data Science Project Structure

This project follows a standard, professional folder structure to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and ease of collaboration.

## Folder Overview

- `data/` — Store all raw and processed datasets here. **Do not modify raw data.**
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and reporting.
- `scripts/` — Standalone Python scripts for data processing, modeling, or automation.
- `outputs/` — Generated results, figures, and model outputs. Never overwrite raw data.

## Best Practices
- Keep code, data, and outputs separate.
- Use clear, consistent folder names.
- Avoid deeply nested folders.
- Make paths predictable for easy collaboration.

This structure helps your project scale, remain organized, and be easy for others to understand and review.

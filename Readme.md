# Milestone: Launching Jupyter Notebook and Understanding the Home Interface

## Overview
This milestone is about mastering the basics of Jupyter Notebook navigation and file management before starting any data science work. You will learn to launch Jupyter Notebook, understand its interface, navigate folders, and manage notebook files confidently.

## Why This Matters
Many early data science issues arise from:
- Running notebooks from the wrong directory
- Creating files in unintended locations
- Losing track of datasets or notebooks
- Confusion about which environment or kernel is active

This milestone ensures:
- Your notebooks live where your project expects them
- Your data, notebooks, and scripts stay organized
- You avoid silent workflow mistakes early in the sprint

## What You Are Expected to Do
This is a navigation and familiarity milestone, not an analysis task. You are expected to:
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook from the terminal
2. Understand the Home interface layout
3. Navigate folders intentionally
4. Create and open a notebook
5. Verify that the notebook runs correctly
6. Manage notebook files (rename, save, close, reopen)

No data analysis or modeling is required.

### 1. Launching Jupyter Notebook
- Ensure the correct Conda environment is active
- Launch Jupyter using the terminal command:
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Confirm that Jupyter opens in your web browser without errors
- Pay attention to the directory from which Jupyter is launched, as this determines the root folder shown in the interface

### 2. Understanding the Jupyter Home Interface
Once Jupyter opens, explore the Home interface. Identify:
- The file and folder listing area
- Navigation breadcrumbs
- Buttons for creating new files and notebooks
- Indicators for file types (folders, notebooks, scripts)

### 3. Navigating Project Folders
- Move into and out of directories
- Locate your project folder
- Understand how folder navigation maps to your local file system

### 4. Creating and Opening a Notebook
- Create a notebook in the correct folder
- Open the notebook
- Confirm that it uses the expected Python kernel
- Run a simple cell to ensure the notebook executes correctly

### 5. Notebook File Management Basics
- Rename a notebook
- Save changes
- Close the notebook safely
- Reopen it from the Home interface

### 6. Video Walkthrough (~2 Minutes)
Record a short screen-capture video demonstrating your understanding. Your video must include:
- Launching Jupyter Notebook from the terminal
- A walkthrough of the Home interface
- Navigating folders
- Creating and opening a notebook
- Running a simple cell

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Submit your work as a Pull Request (if required)
- Submit the video link as instructed
- Video should be approximately 2 minutes
- Video must be screen-facing and clearly visible
- Keep explanations concise and focused on navigation and understanding

## Important Notes
- This milestone is about orientation and confidence, not analysis
- Do not start EDA or data loading yet
- Always be aware of the folder you are working in
- Treat notebooks as project artifacts, not temporary scratchpads

Understanding Jupyter’s workspace early prevents disorganization later. This milestone ensures you can navigate, create, and manage notebooks intentionally throughout the Data Science sprint.

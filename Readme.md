# Milestone 4.8: Understanding Notebook Cells: Code vs Markdown

## Overview
This milestone focuses on one of the most important fundamentals of working in Jupyter Notebooks: understanding the difference between **Code cells** and **Markdown cells**, and knowing when to use each.

Notebooks are not just places to run code. They are **living documents** that combine execution and explanation. Learning to use cells correctly is essential for readable, reviewable, and professional Data Science work.

## Learning Objectives
This lesson is to help you:

- Clearly distinguish between Code cells and Markdown cells
- Understand the role each cell type plays in a notebook
- Use cells intentionally to separate execution from explanation
- Build notebooks that are readable to others, not just runnable

By completing this milestone, you will be able to:

- Create and switch between Code and Markdown cells
- Execute Code cells correctly
- Write basic Markdown to explain what your code is doing
- Structure a notebook so that logic and explanation are clearly separated

## Why This Matters
A common beginner mistake is:

- Writing explanations inside code comments only
- Leaving notebooks as long, unexplained code dumps
- Mixing reasoning and execution in unreadable ways

In real DS workflows:

- **Code shows what you did**
- **Markdown explains why you did it and what it means**

This milestone ensures your notebooks are:

- Understandable to teammates and reviewers
- Easier to debug and extend
- Aligned with professional DS practices

## What You Are Expected to Do
This is a **fundamentals and structure milestone**, not a data analysis task.

You are expected to:

- Create both Code and Markdown cells
- Use each cell type correctly
- Demonstrate intentional notebook structure
- Explain code behavior using Markdown, not just comments

**No dataset or analysis is required.**

## 1. Understanding Code Cells
Code cells are used to **execute Python code**.

You should:

- Write simple Python statements in Code cells
- Execute cells and observe outputs
- Understand that only Code cells run computations

**Code cells should contain logic, not explanations.**

---

## 2. Understanding Markdown Cells
Markdown cells are used to **explain, describe, and structure** your notebook.

You should:

- Convert a cell to Markdown
- Write headings, short paragraphs, and bullet points
- Use Markdown to explain what the next Code cell will do or what the output means

**Markdown cells should contain reasoning and narrative, not code execution.**

---

## 3. Switching Between Cell Types
Practice switching cells between Code and Markdown.

You should:

- Create new cells of each type
- Convert existing cells between types
- Understand when and why to choose one over the other

This ensures you can fix mistakes and structure notebooks cleanly.

---

## 4. Structuring a Simple Notebook
Create a short notebook structure such as:

- A Markdown title at the top
- A Markdown cell explaining the purpose of the notebook
- One or two Code cells with simple Python commands
- Markdown cells explaining what each Code cell does

**The goal is clarity, not complexity.**

---

## 5. Video Walkthrough (~2 Minutes)
Record a short screen-capture video demonstrating your understanding.

Your video must include:
- Creating a Code cell and running it
- Creating a Markdown cell and rendering it
- Switching a cell type
- Explaining when to use Code vs Markdown

This validates both understanding and correct usage.

---

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your work as a Pull Request (if required by the assignment)
- Submit the video link as instructed
- Video should be approximately 2 minutes
- Video must be screen-facing and clearly visible

---

## Important Notes
- This milestone is about **intentional notebook writing**
- Do not perform EDA or load datasets
- Keep examples simple and focused
- Treat notebooks as documents meant to be read by humans

**Using Code and Markdown correctly is a core professional habit.** This milestone ensures you can write notebooks that communicate, not just compute, throughout the Data Science sprint.

# 📊 Data Science Lifecycle: From Question to Insight

## 📌 Overview
This repository represents a structured approach to solving a data-driven problem by following the data science lifecycle. Instead of directly jumping into coding or analysis, the focus is on understanding how a problem is framed, how data is used as evidence, and how insights are generated.

The project is organized to reflect each stage of the lifecycle—from defining the question to deriving meaningful conclusions—so that anyone exploring the repository can easily understand the flow of work and the decisions made along the way.

---

## 🎯 Problem Understanding
Every data science project begins with a clear question.

In this project, the focus is on:
- Identifying a real-world problem or area of curiosity  
- Converting it into a clear, specific, and actionable question  
- Understanding the context in which the answer will be used  

This step ensures that the analysis remains focused and meaningful rather than just exploring data without direction.

## 📂 Repository Structure & Workflow
The repository is organized to reflect different stages of the data science lifecycle:

- **data/** → Contains raw or processed datasets used for analysis  
- **notebooks/** → Includes exploratory analysis and step-by-step investigation  
- **src/** → Reusable scripts or functions (if applicable)  
- **reports/ or outputs/** → Final insights, visualizations, or summaries  

This structure helps distinguish between:
- Exploratory work vs finalized outputs  
- Raw data vs processed data  
- Analysis vs conclusions

## 📄 Role of README
This README serves as the entry point to the project. It provides:

- A clear understanding of the problem being addressed  
- An overview of the dataset and its limitations  
- The approach followed during analysis  
- Guidance on how the repository is structured  

It is designed to help anyone quickly understand the intent of the project without needing to go through every file.

---

## 📊 Understanding the Data
Data in this project is treated as evidence, not absolute truth.

Key considerations:
- Data sources may include files, APIs, or collected datasets  
- Data may contain missing values, inconsistencies, or biases  
- Not all datasets perfectly represent real-world scenarios  

Before analysis, the data is evaluated to determine whether it is suitable for answering the problem.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before making conclusions, the project focuses on exploring the data.

This includes:
- Understanding distributions and patterns  
- Identifying anomalies or unusual values  
- Using basic statistics and visualizations  

The goal is to observe and understand the data first, rather than jumping to predictions or conclusions.

---

## 💡 Insights & Interpretation
After exploration, observations are converted into meaningful insights.

- Findings are connected back to the original question  
- Results are explained clearly and simply  
- Limitations and uncertainties are acknowledged  

This ensures that conclusions are realistic and supported by data.

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
Every data science project involves assumptions.

In this project:
- Data quality and completeness may affect results  
- Some patterns may not generalize beyond the dataset  
- Certain questions may remain partially unanswered  

Recognizing these limitations is important for responsible analysis.

## 🛠️ Environment Verification (Milestone 1)

This section documents the verification of the Data Science environment as required for the sprint. The goal is to ensure a stable, reproducible setup for all future work.

### 1. Operating System
- **Windows**

### 2. Python Verification
- **Command:** `python --version`
- **Output:**
	```
	Python 3.X.X
	```
- **Python REPL test:**
	```
	>>> print("Hello, Data Science!")
	Hello, Data Science!
	```

### 3. Conda Verification
- **Command:** `conda --version`
- **Output:**
	```
	conda X.X.X
	```
- **List environments:** `conda env list`
- **Activate environment:** `conda activate base`
- **Confirmation:** Prompt shows `(base)` or your environment name

### 4. Jupyter Verification
- **Command:** `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
- **Result:** Jupyter launches in browser without errors
- **Notebook test:**
	- Created a new notebook
	- Ran a Python cell:
		```python
		print("Jupyter is working!")
		```
	- Output displays as expected

### 5. Summary
- All core tools (Python, Conda, Jupyter) are installed and functional
- Environment is ready for Data Science workflows

---
